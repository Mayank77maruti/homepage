Since the COVID crisis, remote work has become established among Tunisians, and more and more people have continued this way. According to various statistics, people are much more productive while working remotely, leading to a boom in coworking spaces.

In an era where there are increasingly more freelancers, independents, and young startups, a pleasant shared space is essential for being as productive as possible.

A coworking space offers more than just a desk: a significant advantage of working there is the community surrounding the space. We all know that networking is one of the pillars of success for a business or a freelancer.

Today, we wanted to introduce you to the 5 best coworking spaces in Sousse.
